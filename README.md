# 368_Project_1
Pokemon inspired turn-based combat as the game project for EECS 368.

First you select your team based on the 6 rows which have been shuffled to contain one character class each.
The types will be random but no two of the same types will be on the same team.
There are 6 types: fire, water, grass, sound, gravity, flying

Your opponent will take a different team.

There are 4 attacks to choose from every turn.

You can switch your character, but it takes up the turn.

After beating your opponent's team, you win.
